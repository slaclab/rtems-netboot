/* an ugly hack to intercept CTRL chars on the console for
 * because libtecla doesn't have provision for callbacks
 * or user-defined key handlers :-(
 *
 * The idea is to use this as follows:
 *
 * a) at init: call installConsoleCtrlXHack()
 *    add tecla bindings for the control chars to 'newline'
 *
 * b) while () {
 * 		gl_get_line();
 *
 * 		if (getConsoleSpecialChar() >= 0) {
 * 			/ * a special char was pressed, process * /
 * 		}
 *    }

/* magicChar causes a reboot;
 *
 * the special lowlevel handler listens for any
 * char listed added by addConsoleSpecialChar() and
 * remembers the first one encountered in a
 * static variable.
 *
 * RETURNS always 0
 *
 * NOTE: This routine hacks into the current line discipline
 *       by installing a l_rint method to inspect all incoming
 *       characters. Hence, the hack must be installed *after*
 *       changing the line discipline, if any.
 *
 *       The caller must provide a routine that causes a hard-reset.
 *       She may pass a NULL pointer to uninstall the hack.
 *
 * RETURNS: 0 on success, -errno on error.
